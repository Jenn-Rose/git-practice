                <h4>~Remember your <strong>why</strong>~</h4>
                <p> Many of us have a specific why when we start coding; whether it be to increase income, challenge ourselves to a learn a new skill, have a more flexible
                    work schedule, or any other number of reasons. That why was important enough to begin the journey into coding, and is important enough to continue.
                    Write it down where you can see it, and think about it when things get tough. Is it still worth it, if so, keep going! </p>

            
 
                <h4>~Set aside time to code every day~</h4>
                <p> One of my biggest struggles is getting busy and deciding to skip my homework time and promise myself I will "catch up on it" the next day. But sometimes during a busy week that turns into 
                    multiple days of skipping out on coding time, then I have to go back and review a lesson to remember where I was at. I have found That
                    the best way to keep on top of things is setting aside time every day for homework. Even if it is just fifteen minutes to review, it keeps me from getting "behind" 
                    and makes sure I am still moving forward in lessons.
                </p>
               
                 <h4>~Stay curious!~</h4>
                <p>There is always more to learn! Keep pushing forward and discovering what types of coding languages and projects most appeal to you!</p>
